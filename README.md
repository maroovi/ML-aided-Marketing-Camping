In today's world where each bank is offering huge amount of services to its millions of customer across the globe there is dire need for financial institutions 
to generate a steady revenue using the deposits created by their customers. Targeting a potential customer using various mediums like social media, telemarketing, 
digital media and paid partnerships to lure in the customers. But how can banks predict with accuracy to a specific group of customers using a variety of 
parameters like location, marital status, type of campaign etc. This is where predictive analytics comes in to spot light, where we use the data and 
machine learning models to strategize insights from the fields to layout which customers are likely to opt in for a product offered by the bank. 

At the beginning of the process we start with the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to study about the data points eliminating the imbalances, outliers, missing data,
NAs and visualizing the summary statistics of each variable considered in the model building. We further proceed with the data processing methods in handling 
all the bad data like cleaning the outliers. Since our dataset used here to build the machine learning model holds disparate attributes of which considering 
all in building the model would end up in Overfitting. To avoid such grave mistake we proceed with methods of dimensionality reduction.

â€¨Further we proceed with another aspect in machine learning of Feature Engineering, where we shall study in classifying the data in numerical and categorical
 features and if needed creating additional features to keep our error rate in our model prediction as minimal as possible. Once the data is featured we move on to
 the building training, validation and test samples. This aspect allows the data points from the featured analysis to be effectively used in iterating and modeling 
 the best fit prediction.
